# yScroll

yScroll scrolls a background image at a speed relative to the page scroll to create a vertical parallax effect. This effect can be applied to multiple elements.

Unlike other parallax scrollers, this module uses `requestAnimationFrame` in place of scroll events for huge performance benefits.

## Usage

Apply your background image using CSS:

    body {
      background-image: url("../images/blue-bg.svg");
      background-attachment: fixed;
    }

Then add the `ys` class to your HTML element, and then any of the following settings (namespaced with `ys`):

    <body class="ys" data-ys-speed="0.5" data-ys-invert="true">
      â€¦
    </body>

**Speed** is relative to the user's scrolling (default is `0.5`). **Invert** is a boolean which specifies whether the effect should be inverted (default is `false`).
